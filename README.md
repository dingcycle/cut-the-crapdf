# Context

If you don't have a smartphone and still print your e-tickets for a train
company like the french SNCF, you might want to only print what's necessary
for the control team and yourself: your **schedule** and the 
**[QR Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code)**.

Here's a way to only keep the top part of each A4 page (the smart ones will
realize this gives multiple baby A5 pages), and assemble them in A4 pages again.

In a general case, you've split the number of A4 pages by two and have thus killed
half less kittens (your mileage may vary).

# Usage


```
./cut_the_crapdf.sh original_ticket.pdf 
          [...]
  pdfjam: Finished.  Output was to 'original_ticket_condensed.pdf'.
```

It created one intermediary file (suffixed `_cropped`) 
and the `condensed`-suffixed file is the one that interests us. Voil√†!

```
$ ls original_ticket*
original_ticket_condensed.pdf  original_ticket_cropped.pdf  original_ticket.pdf
```

Check with pdfinfo.

Before:
```
$ pdfinfo original_ticket.pdf | grep -E 'Pages|Page size'
Pages:          8
Page size:      595 x 842 pts (A4)

```

After
```
$ pdfinfo original_ticket_condensed.pdf | grep -E 'Pages|Page size'
Pages:          4
Page size:      595.276 x 841.89 pts (A4)
```
